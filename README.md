# King-s-Hall-Strategy-Console-Game
This is a console strategy game called King's Hall. The game is currently still under development. all published codes are the idea and the vision that game has. 
I want people to be able to create their own towns and cities so I am going to be creating a game that is easy to edit and change anything that is unwanted in the game.
Once the game goes fully published you will be able to play it on your console and able to change the factions and campaign according to your own choices.
Thank you.
